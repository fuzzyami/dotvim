# This is my .vimrc

I'm usually working with Python/Django and HTML/CSS/JavaScript, so my Vim IDE is configured for these languages.

Also there's some configurations for languages used in my CS BSc degree, C/C++, nasm, Java, Racket (Scheme), SML to name a few.

All of the plugins are installed and updated via [Vundle plugin manager](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle)!

Have fun and fork at will! :)

# Quick start

1. Clone repo.
2. [Initialize Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle/blob/master/README.md).
3. My `vimrc` is written to be easy to grasp.

**Enjoy!** :)
